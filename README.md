# GBFFateEpisodeSkipper
Javascript that redirects for fate episide to ease clearing fate episode (skipping fate episode script)

1) install Tempermonkey (Chrome) - https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en
2) enable the script when you're using it
3) just click into fate episode and it will redirect from the dialog to result and from result to fate episode.
4) disable when you're done to avoid conflict with any other page as this code is pretty much just thrown up together because i was trying to clear 12 pages of fate episode.
